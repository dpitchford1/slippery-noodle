# Technical Decisions & Considerations

## Data Storage Strategy

### Primary Database: SQLite
- **Rationale**: Lightweight, file-based, perfect for single-user application
- **Implementation**: 
  - Use Sequelize ORM for structured data access
  - Implement migrations for schema evolution
  - Regular backups to prevent data loss

### Component-Specific Storage
- **Todo List**: SQLite tables with relationships for tasks and groups
- **News Feed**: Cache RSS content in SQLite with TTL
- **Weather**: Short-term memory cache with periodic updates
- **Reference Guide**: SQLite for snippets with full-text search capabilities
- **Command Executor**: File-based history with limited retention

### Caching Strategy
- In-memory cache for frequently accessed data
- Filesystem cache for API responses
- Implement stale-while-revalidate pattern for UI responsiveness

## API Integration Approach

### External API Adapters
- Create adapter pattern for each external API
- Abstract common functionality (authentication, rate limiting)
- Implement retry mechanisms and graceful degradation
- Use appropriate caching based on data volatility

### API Selection Criteria
1. Documentation quality and completeness
2. Rate limits and pricing tiers
3. Data freshness and update frequency
4. Authentication requirements
5. Community support and reliability

### API Categories and Options

| Category | Primary Option | Fallback Option | Considerations |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Weather | OpenWeatherMap | WeatherAPI | Free tier limits, location accuracy |
| Sports | ESPN API | Sports Data IO | Game coverage, update frequency |
| News | RSS Feeds | NewsAPI | Source variety, content formatting |
| Jobs | LinkedIn API | Indeed API | Authentication requirements |

## System Integration

### Command Execution
- Use Node.js child_process with proper sanitization
- Implement allowlist of permitted commands
- Log all execution attempts for security
- Sandbox execution environment

### File System Access
- Restricted to specific directories
- Use proper error handling for permissions
- Implement file watching for directory changes
- Cache directory contents with invalidation

### Browser Integration
- Use URL protocol handlers for opening links
- Implement clipboard integration for snippets
- Consider browser extension for deeper integration

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Basic Setup (Recommended for v1)
- Run as localhost service with PM2
- Configure as startup service
- Access via browser bookmark
- Pros: Simple setup, minimal dependencies
- Cons: Limited system integration

### Option 2: Enhanced Desktop Experience
- Package as Electron app
- System tray integration
- Native notifications
- Pros: Better system integration, standalone application
- Cons: Larger footprint, additional complexity

### Option 3: Development Only
- Run manually during development sessions
- No background service
- Pros: Simplest setup
- Cons: Must be manually started, no background functionality

## Performance Considerations

### Frontend Optimization
- Implement code splitting for components
- Use React.memo for expensive renders
- Virtual scrolling for long lists
- Web workers for intensive operations

### Backend Optimization
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Connection pooling
- Request batching where appropriate
- Background processing for long-running tasks

## Extensibility Design

### Plugin Architecture
- Define standard widget interface
- Component registry for dynamic loading
- Standardized event communication
- Settings schema for configuration

### Configuration Management
- User preferences stored in database
- Component-specific settings
- Export/import configuration
- Default settings with override capability
