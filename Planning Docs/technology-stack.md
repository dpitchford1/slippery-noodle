# Technology Stack for Personal Dashboard

## Frontend Technologies

### Framework: React.js
- **Rationale**: Component-based architecture perfect for modular dashboard, extensive ecosystem, excellent for creating interactive UIs
- **Alternative**: Vue.js if you prefer a gentler learning curve

### State Management
- Redux or Context API for global state management
- React Query for data fetching and caching

### UI Components
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Optional component library: Chakra UI (accessible, themeable components)

## Backend Technologies

### Runtime: Node.js with Express.js
- **Rationale**: JavaScript across the stack, lightweight for local usage, extensive packages

### Database
- SQLite for local persistent storage (todos, snippets, notes)
- **Rationale**: Self-contained, zero-configuration, perfect for single-user applications

### API Integration
- Axios for external API calls (weather, sports, news)
- RSS parser libraries for news feeds

## System Architecture

### Local Daemon
- PM2 for Node.js process management (keeps the app running in background)
- Electron as an alternative for desktop application packaging

## Technology Justification

| Requirement | Technology Choice | Justification |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Modular Components | React.js | Component-based architecture allows each dashboard widget to be developed independently |
| Local Database | SQLite | Lightweight, file-based database perfect for single-user applications with no authentication |
| Always-on Service | PM2/Electron | Provides process management to keep the application running in the background |
| External Data Sources | Axios + Custom APIs | Flexible HTTP client for integrating with various external APIs |
| Manual Refresh | React State | State management allows for manual refresh triggers without complex polling |
| Directory Scanning | Node.js fs module | Native filesystem access for directory scanning functionality |
| Command Execution | Node.js child_process | Secure execution of system commands within controlled environment |
