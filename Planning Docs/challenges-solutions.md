# Challenges and Solutions

## Potential Challenges & Mitigation Strategies

| Challenge | Description | Potential Solutions |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Data Scraping Limitations** | Job boards and sports sites may have anti-scraping measures | - Use official APIs where available<br>- Implement proper request throttling<br>- Consider browser automation as fallback<br>- Use RSS feeds when available |
| **Always-On Functionality** | Keeping the app running as a background service | - Use PM2 for process management<br>- Create a macOS launch agent<br>- Package as an Electron app<br>- Implement auto-restart on failure |
| **External API Rate Limits** | Free tiers of weather/sports APIs have usage limits | - Implement aggressive caching<br>- Reduce polling frequency<br>- Show last-updated timestamps<br>- Consider paid API tiers for critical services |
| **Command Execution Security** | Security concerns with command execution component | - Whitelist allowed commands<br>- Sandbox execution environment<br>- Implement permission checks<br>- Log all command executions |
| **Data Synchronization** | Future requirement for syncing with mobile devices | - Consider Firebase or PouchDB for offline-first sync<br>- Implement conflict resolution strategies<br>- Design for eventual consistency |
| **UI Responsiveness** | Dashboard with multiple components may affect performance | - Implement lazy loading<br>- Use virtualization for lists<br>- Optimize render cycles<br>- Code-split components |
| **On-Demand Startup** | Managing application startup and shutdown efficiently | - Use npm scripts for easy startup<br>- Implement proper shutdown procedures<br>- Add startup options to command executor<br>- Consider desktop shortcuts |

## Component-Specific Challenges

### News Component
- **Challenge**: RSS feed availability and standardization
- **Solution**: Create adapter pattern for different feed formats, implement fallback to web scraping

### Todo List Component
- **Challenge**: Data persistence and history tracking
- **Solution**: Use SQLite with versioned records, implement soft deletion

### Sports Scores Component
- **Challenge**: Finding reliable free API for sports data
- **Solution**: Research ESPN, SportRadar, or open APIs; implement caching to reduce API calls

### Job Postings Component
- **Challenge**: Authentication requirements for job boards
- **Solution**: Evaluate official APIs first, consider scraping with proper headers and intervals

### Weather Component
- **Challenge**: API limitations and data granularity
- **Solution**: Use OpenWeatherMap or similar with appropriate caching strategy

### Quick Command Executor
- **Challenge**: Security and sandboxing
- **Solution**: Use allowlist approach, sanitize inputs, restrict execution environment

## Technical Debt Considerations

- Implement proper logging from the start to aid debugging
- Create an abstraction layer for external APIs to simplify future provider changes
- Design database schema with future requirements in mind
- Document code and architecture decisions early
